
Phage Lite has the ability to update itself. It no longer relies on a repository being installed to update.

You can set the update behavior in Settings->General->Manage Addon Updates.

For "Update Action" there are 4 choices:

1. PROMPT: Phage Lite will enact a confirm dialog for you to interact with when an update is available.
2. AUTOMATIC: Phage Lite will automatically install the new version of itself when an update is available.
3. NOTIFICATION: Phage Lite will display a notification when an update is available. Users will have to install the update manually (see below).
4. OFF: Phage Lite will not even check if there is an update available.

If you need to update Phage Lite manually, navigate to Tools->Update Utilities and select "Check for Updates". A confirm dialog will appear and you can select to install the update.
